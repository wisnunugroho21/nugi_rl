# NugiRL

NugiRL is a framework intended to facilitate the development of new reinforcement learning algorithms and/or implementation of existing reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. By using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concept, This framwork will make it easier to develop and/or implement RL algorithm by extending some part of the framework and adding or changing them.
