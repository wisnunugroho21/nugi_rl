# nugi_rl

This framework is intended to make it easier to develop new RL algorithms. Unlike Stable Baselines, this framework is not supposed to be a rapid prototyping, but rather a guide and/or assistant for creating new RL algorithms. This framework can also be a guide for every newcomer to the world of RL
