# NugiRL

NugiRL is a framework intended to facilitate the development of new reinforcement learning algorithms and/or implementation of existing reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch. By using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concept, This framwork will it easier to develop or implement RL algorithm by extending some part of the framework and adding or changing some part of the framework.
